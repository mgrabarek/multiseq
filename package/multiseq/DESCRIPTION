Description: Multiseq has two main modes of operation: smoothing and ,...... Given one (or more) observed one dimensional signal(s) generated by an underlying Poisson distribution multiseq can provide an estimate of the mean and standard error of the original distribution. Given two groups of observed one dimensional signals generated by two underlying Poisson distributions multiseq can provide an estimate of the mean difference and standard error between the two distributions. The main assumption of ... is that ...
