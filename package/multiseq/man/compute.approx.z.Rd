\title{compute.approx.z
Compute a vector of logit(p) given a vector of successes and failures, as well as its variance estimates (MLE with approximation at endpoints for mean; a mix of Berkso's estimator and Tukey's estimator for variance)}

  return.p = FALSE)
}
\value{
a list with elements "mu", "var" and optionally "p"
